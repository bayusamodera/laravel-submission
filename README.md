# Laravel Beginner Demo-Project: Personal Blog

demo requirement brief

---

This repository is intentionally empty, with only a Readme file. Your task is to submit a Pull Request with your version of implementing the task and your PR will be reviewed by our team.

---

You need to create a simple Article with just 5 pages:

- Homepage: List of articles
- Article page to show single Article
- Create page to create new Article
- Edit page to update existing Article
- Some static text page like "About me"

Also, there should be a Login mechanism with Register for the author to write articles:

- Manage (meaning, create/update/delete) categories
- Manage tags
- Manage articles
- For Auth Starter Kit, use [Laravel Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze) (Tailwind) or [Laravel UI](https://github.com/laravel/ui) (Bootstrap) - that starter kit will have some design, which is enough: the design is irrelevant for accomplishing the task

**DB Structure:**

- Article has title (required), full text (required), and image to upload (optional)
- Article may have only one category, but may have multiple tags
